# Multi-Distro Testing Guide

ODS supports multiple Linux distributions. This guide covers how to test across distros efficiently.

## Real Hardware Fleet Validation

ODS also uses a private real-hardware fleet for release-readiness
evidence. CI, Docker containers, Distrobox, and Incus VMs are useful for fast
installer logic, package-manager, systemd, and Docker-daemon checks, but the
physical fleet is where fresh installs, Docker startup, GPU runtime behavior,
dashboard flows, Hermes auth, model switching, extension install paths, and
agent capabilities are exercised on real machines.

The sanitized public coverage is maintained in
[VALIDATION-MATRIX.md](VALIDATION-MATRIX.md). Release notes should cite the
fleet run date, hardware classes covered, regression replay result, and any
blocked, deferred, skipped, or not-run phases.

Volunteer and community testers are important for broader distro, GPU, driver,
and network coverage. Treat those reports as complementary breadth evidence;
the physical fleet is the repeatable parallel gate that can run whenever code
changes.

Fleet phases currently include:

- zero-prereq bootstrap checks from clean distro containers that do not assume
  Git, jq, Python, Docker, or Compose are already installed;
- regression replay for previously fixed fleet bugs;
- a constrained Apple Silicon smoke gate before parallel installs;
- read-only preflight snapshots for OS, RAM, disk, Docker, firewall, ports, and
  prior install state;
- non-interactive fresh installs from the public bootstrap path;
- cloud-mode contract checks for local, cloud, hybrid, and external-backend
  compose/config behavior;
- core HTTP verification for dashboard-api, dashboard UI, llama-server, and
  Hermes proxy;
- dashboard model and extension flows;
- Hermes magic-link auth and seeded chat checks;
- Playwright dashboard UI checks;
- agent capability probes for chat, web search, files, code, skills, loaded-model
  identity, context, and ODS Talk/owner-portal surfaces where enabled;
- lifecycle checks for idempotent reinstall, `ods restart`, and
  `ods doctor`;
- release-confidence reporting that rolls the run up into zero-prereq,
  install, product, capability, lifecycle, and user-facing gates.

`--phase all` is the faster development sweep. It covers the main install and
post-install product surfaces but intentionally avoids the slowest release-only
gates. The private release-grade sweep adds zero-prereq bootstrap and lifecycle
checks so a green result means the installer, product, capability, and recovery
paths all passed or were explicitly accounted for.

Use the release-grade sweep after operational code changes: installer phases,
bootstrap, compose stack generation, service wiring, dashboard/API behavior,
Hermes, model routing, GPU detection, lifecycle commands, or any runtime path
that could affect a user's install or running stack. Docs-only and cosmetic
changes can usually rely on CI plus focused documentation checks.

External Lemonade SDK compatibility has a focused fleet smoke:

```bash
tests/fleet-external-lemonade-e2e.sh --mock
```

The mock lane starts a tiny OpenAI-compatible Lemonade stand-in, renders the
external-Lemonade LiteLLM config, starts ODS's real LiteLLM compose
service, and verifies a chat completion traverses the route. On an AMD Linux
host with Lemonade SDK already running, use the real lane:

```bash
LEMONADE_E2E_URL=http://localhost:13305 \
LEMONADE_E2E_MODEL=<model-from-/api/v1/models> \
tests/fleet-external-lemonade-e2e.sh --real
```

## Quick Reference

| Method | Speed | GPU Testing | Kernel Testing | Best For |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Fleet harness** | 15-75 min | Yes | Yes | Release readiness and User Green confidence on real heterogeneous hardware |
| **Fleet distro lab** | 5-20 min | No | Container: no / VM: yes | Multi-distro installer and Docker lifecycle coverage on a private lab host |
| **Distrobox** | Instant (2s) | Yes | No | Daily dev, package manager validation |
| **Ventoy USB** | 5-10 min boot | Yes | Yes | Weekly full-stack validation |
| **CI Matrix** | Automatic | No | No | Every PR, syntax + detection checks |

## Fleet Distro Lab

The fleet distro lab is the repeatable middle rung between CI containers and
full hardware fleet runs. The private lab host is provisioned with:

- Docker for fast disposable distro containers;
- Distrobox for interactive distro debugging;
- Incus + KVM/QEMU for disposable systemd-capable VMs.

If the host firewall is active, allow the Incus bridge to serve DHCP/DNS and
NAT guest traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw allow in on incusbr0 from any to any
sudo ufw route allow in on incusbr0 from any to any
```

Use the Docker runner for every fleet run:

```bash
cd ~/ODS/ods
tests/fleet-multi-distro.sh --pull
```

The Docker and Incus distro runners take a shared host lock by default:
`/tmp/dream-fleet-heavy.lock`. Set `ODS_FLEET_HOST_LOCK` to override it;
the older `DREAM_FLEET_HOST_LOCK` name is still honored for release automation
compatibility. The private release automation uses the same lock when launching
heavy install work, so distro-lab dry-runs do not compete with full fleet
installs for Docker/build I/O on the same host. Use `--lock-timeout SECONDS`
when a CI or automation should fail instead of waiting, and reserve
`--no-host-lock` for local debugging when you know no full fleet install is
running.

Release-grade fleet runs should run the distro lab alongside the hardware
fleet. The hardware fleet proves GPU and product behavior; the distro lab proves
the same installer logic still handles broad Linux package-manager and
Docker-daemon surfaces.

Run a focused subset while debugging:

```bash
tests/fleet-multi-distro.sh ubuntu/24.04 archlinux/current mint
tests/fleet-multi-distro.sh --no-dry-run ubuntu2404
```

The fast fleet matrix currently covers:

| Distro ID | Image | Package Manager |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| `ubuntu2404` | `ubuntu:24.04` | apt |
| `ubuntu2204` | `ubuntu:22.04` | apt |
| `debian12` | `debian:12` | apt |
| `mint213` | `linuxmintd/mint21.3-amd64:latest` | apt |
| `fedora41` | `fedora:41` | dnf |
| `rocky9` | `rockylinux:9` | dnf |
| `arch` | `archlinux:latest` | pacman |
| `manjaro` | `manjarolinux/base:latest` | pacman |
| `cachyos` | `cachyos/cachyos:latest` | pacman |
| `opensuse` | `opensuse/tumbleweed:latest` | zypper |

Aliases such as `ubuntu/24.04`, `ubuntu/22.04`, `debian/12`,
`fedora/41`, `archlinux/current`, `opensuse/tumbleweed`, and `mint` are
accepted by the runner for quick ad-hoc checks. The matrix uses Linux Mint
21.3 because the current Mint 22 Docker images report plain Ubuntu in
`/etc/os-release`, which is less useful for distro detection.

Use the Incus VM runner when a regression needs real systemd, boot, kernel, or
Docker daemon behavior:

```bash
tests/fleet-incus-vm.sh
tests/fleet-incus-vm.sh ubuntu/24.04 archlinux/current
tests/fleet-incus-vm.sh --keep-vms rocky9
```

The VM matrix intentionally stays smaller than the Docker matrix because it
boots full virtual machines and installs Docker inside each guest. It currently
covers:

| Distro ID | Incus image | Package Manager | VM Checks |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `ubuntu2404` | `images:ubuntu/24.04` | apt | systemd, Docker daemon, installer dry-run |
| `fedora42` | `images:fedora/42` | dnf | systemd, Docker daemon, installer dry-run |
| `rocky9` | `images:rockylinux/9` | dnf | systemd, Docker daemon, installer dry-run |
| `arch` | `images:archlinux/current` | pacman | systemd, Docker daemon, installer dry-run |
| `opensuse` | `images:opensuse/tumbleweed` | zypper | systemd, Docker daemon, installer dry-run |

The Fedora VM lane uses Fedora 42 because the Incus public image server no
longer publishes Fedora 41 VM images. The Docker matrix still keeps
`fedora:41` coverage while the container image is available.

The Rocky VM lane verifies the RHEL-family Docker CE fallback. If Docker's
Rocky repository does not publish installable `docker-ce` packages, the
installer uses the CentOS/RHEL Docker CE repository instead.

For CachyOS, use the container matrix for package-manager coverage. Keep a
manual CachyOS VM template for systemd/kernel coverage because CachyOS publishes
installer ISOs rather than a standard Incus cloud image.

## Distrobox (Daily Testing)

Run any Linux distro as a container on your host machine. GPU passthrough works. No reboot needed.

### Setup (One-Time)

```bash
# Install distrobox
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sudo sh

# Create test containers for target distros
distrobox create --name ods-test-fedora --image fedora:41
distrobox create --name ods-test-arch --image archlinux:latest
distrobox create --name ods-test-manjaro --image manjarolinux/base:latest
distrobox create --name ods-test-cachyos --image cachyos/cachyos:latest
distrobox create --name ods-test-opensuse --image opensuse/tumbleweed:latest
distrobox create --name ods-test-debian --image debian:12
distrobox create --name ods-test-ubuntu2204 --image ubuntu:22.04
distrobox create --name ods-test-mint213 --image linuxmintd/mint21.3-amd64:latest
distrobox create --name ods-test-rocky9 --image rockylinux:9
```

### Usage

```bash
# Switch to any distro instantly
distrobox enter ods-test-fedora
# You're now in Fedora with dnf, GPU visible
cd ~/ods
./install.sh --dry-run

# Exit and switch
exit
distrobox enter ods-test-arch
```

### What Distrobox CAN Test

- Package manager detection (`apt` vs `dnf` vs `pacman` vs `zypper`)
- `/etc/os-release` parsing and distro identification
- Tool availability and installation (`curl`, `jq`, `rsync`, `git`)
- Installer phase logic, error messages, and tier mapping
- Service registry loading and compose file generation
- GPU device visibility (`/dev/dri`, `/dev/nvidia*`)

### What Distrobox CANNOT Test

- Kernel module loading (`modprobe`, `sysctl` tuning)
- Real Docker-in-Docker service startup
- NVIDIA driver installation flow
- Secure Boot interactions
- System tuning file deployment (`/etc/modprobe.d/`, `/etc/sysctl.d/`)

For these, use Ventoy.

## Ventoy USB (Weekly Validation)

Boot any Linux distro from a single USB drive. Pick from a menu, boot into a live session, test with real GPU access.

### Setup (One-Time)

1. Get a **64GB+ USB 3.2** drive (boot speed matters)
2. Download Ventoy from [ventoy.net](https://ventoy.net)
3. Install Ventoy on the USB (this formats it)
4. Copy ISO files onto the USB partition — it's just a normal filesystem

### Recommended ISOs

| Distro | Why | Package Manager |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Primary target | apt |
| Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Still widely used | apt |
| Fedora 41 | Popular with devs | dnf |
| CachyOS | Arch-based, issue #33 | pacman |
| openSUSE Tumbleweed | Rolling release | zypper |
| Debian 12 | apt but not Ubuntu | apt |
| Linux Mint 21.3 | Ubuntu derivative with `ID=linuxmint` | apt |
| Rocky Linux 9 | RHEL-family server baseline | dnf |
| Manjaro | Arch derivative with desktop-user reach | pacman |

Total: ~25GB for all ISOs.

### Testing Workflow

1. Plug USB into test machine (Strix Halo tower, NVIDIA tower, etc.)
2. Boot from USB (F12/F2 at POST)
3. Select distro from Ventoy menu
4. Live session boots with network access
5. Open terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/ODS.git
   cd ODS
   ./install.sh
   ```
6. Note what breaks
7. Reboot, pick next distro, repeat

**Time per distro:** ~10-15 minutes.

### Ventoy Persistence (Optional)

To keep installed packages and configs across reboots:

1. Create a persistence file: `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/ventoy/persistence.dat bs=1G count=10`
2. Format it: `sudo mkfs.ext4 /ventoy/persistence.dat`
3. Configure in `ventoy.json`

## Automated Test Script

Run installer validation across all Distrobox containers automatically:

```bash
# Create all test containers
./tests/test-multi-distro.sh --create

# Run all distros
./tests/test-multi-distro.sh

# Run specific distros
./tests/test-multi-distro.sh fedora41 arch cachyos mint213

# Clean up
./tests/test-multi-distro.sh --cleanup
```

### Output Example

```
━━━ Testing: fedora41 ━━━
  [PASS] fedora41: /etc/os-release ID=fedora
  [PASS] fedora41: package manager detected correctly (dnf)
  [PASS] fedora41: curl available
  [SKIP] fedora41: no GPU devices visible (expected in rootless containers)

## CI Matrix

Every PR automatically tests installer detection on 10 distros via GitHub Actions containers. See `.github/workflows/matrix-smoke.yml`.

**Tested per PR:**
- `/etc/os-release` parsing
- `packaging.sh` package manager detection
- `pkg_install` for core tools (`curl`, `jq`)
- Bash syntax validation on all scripts

## Adding a New Distro

1. Add the distro ID to `installers/lib/packaging.sh` in the `detect_pkg_manager()` case block
2. Add a test entry in `tests/test-multi-distro.sh` DISTROS array
3. Add a fleet entry in `tests/fleet-multi-distro.sh`
4. Add a CI matrix entry in `.github/workflows/matrix-smoke.yml`
5. Test with Distrobox: `distrobox create --name ods-test-newdistro --image newdistro:latest`
6. Run: `./tests/test-multi-distro.sh newdistro`
7. Run the fleet matrix path: `./tests/fleet-multi-distro.sh newdistro`
8. If the distro has an Incus VM image, add a VM lane in `tests/fleet-incus-vm.sh`
   and run `./tests/fleet-incus-vm.sh newdistro`
